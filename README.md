# B_anthracis_adaptation

This repository contains code for random forest analysis and code for detecting mutational hotspots in B. anthracis.

This code was originally used in the paper "The roles of antimicrobial resistance, phage diversity, isolation source, and selection in shaping the genomic architecture of Bacillus anthracis". 

The mutational hotsposts code is a modified version of code originally from Cui et al. 2020 refernced in the paper.
