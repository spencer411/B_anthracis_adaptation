# B_anthracis_adaptation

This repository contains code for random forest analysis and the detection of mutational hotspots in *Bacillus anthracis*.

This code was originally used in the paper "The roles of antimicrobial resistance, phage diversity, isolation source, and selection in shaping the genomic architecture of *Bacillus anthracis*" which can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000616 

The mutational hotsposts code is a modified version of code originally from Cui et al. 2020 (referenced in the paper above).
